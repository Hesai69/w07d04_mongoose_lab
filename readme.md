# 🏋️ Working with Mongo in Node with Express

Let's practice issuing commands to our MongoDb server via HTTP!

## 👷 Setup

- [ ] Fork and clone this repo. 
- [ ] Install your dependencies with `npm install` and start up your server.
- [ ] Start up a mongoDB server!

## 🔬 Getting started

Start poking around.

```

- [ ] Look through `routes/index.js` to see how we're using Mongoose, and connecting to MongoDB
- [ ] Check out `views/index.hbs` what do you thing is happening?
- [ ] Look at '/insert' in `routes/index.js`
- [ ] This app will connect to a mongoDB called "TEST"

### 🤰 Crud
- [ ] Visit '/' and try adding data. 
- [ ] Connect to the MongoDB via the mongoshell to ensure data is making its way there!

```

### 📖 cRud with Mongoose

```

Implement the following route:
/data- gets all the data
/update - updates the specific entry selected
/delete - deletes the specific entry selected
/comments - gets all the comments for a specific entry
/comments/:addcomment - adds a comment to a specific entry

```
